            The Mobile Robot Framework Project is conducted by students as a project work at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg.
            The Goal of this project is to develop a framework for a Raspberry Pi powered robot.
            The framework should serve the purpose of being a demonstrable and convincing proof of the possibilities of platform-independent mobile apps.
            It enables a broad variety of devices to interact physically and virtually with their surrounding environment through the robot.
